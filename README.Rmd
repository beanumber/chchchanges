The purpose of this package is to break down the commits history between multiple users working on a git repository on RStudio. 
This will allow a friendlier preview of who, where and when commits are made.

## Installation

You can install the development version of chchchanges like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("sds270-f24/chchchanges")
```

## Examples

There are different functions that can be called depending on the users needs

### Example 1 

Count the amount of commits from each user

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(chchchanges)
tbl_commits()
summarize_commits()
```

### Example 2

Summarize the hunks within the repository

```{r}
tbl_blame(path = "README.md")
summarize_blame(path = "README.md")
```


### LLM

```{r llm, results='asis'}
summarize_git_with_llm(
  show_prompts = TRUE, 
  user_prompt = "Also assign letter grades to each contributor. Note that GitHub user 'anandaw2' uses the email address 'awilkinson@smith.edu."
) |>
  markdown::mark()
```
