Note that there is already the highlightr package. Perhaps you can find a way to combine this with the git history using the git2r package?

I'm wondering if you can apply the concepts of highlightr to source code, using the git history as "notes", as described here.

Please use this repository and get started!


# Testing
```{r}
library(git2r)
x <- blame(path = "README.md")
y <- str(x)
names <-x$hunks$names
class(x)
hunks<-x$hunks 
```

```{r}


first_hunk <- hunks[[1]]
first_hunk$final_signature$name #this is to get the name of the person

extract_name <- function(hunk) {
  return(hunk$final_signature$name)
}

lapply(hunks,extract_name)
```
